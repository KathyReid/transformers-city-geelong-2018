Matt
Welcome to Geelong - we think it's the best city in Australia, but, we _might_ be a little biased ;-)

I'm MATT _Matt to put introduction in here_

Kathy
And I'm KATHY REID - I'm a technical specialist and was the site lead for GovHack Geelong in 2015 and 2016 - and just to be clear, I'm NOT a City employee - which means I can say things that Matt can't *grin*.



## The Geelong Method - maturity model

Kathy
SLIDE: Capability Maturity Model
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/capabilitymaturity

Today we're going to take you on the journey of Geelong's evolution and transformation of Geelong's open data and smart city thinking. We're going to do this using a *maturity model* framework - many of you will be familiar with these in different disciplines - and the different levels within the maturity model - *The Geelong Method* - will be signposted by several achievements of the City and the region.

We'd love to hear your questions and comments, however please do wait until the end of the talk - we'll warmly welcome them then.



## Level 1 - Lack of data

Matt
SLIDE: Level 1 - Lack of data
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/level1

Our journey starts almost five years ago, with the recognition by the City of the need to recognise the power of Open Data to contribute to the knowledge-based economy the area was transitioning to. At this stage, open data efforts were generally ad-hoc, with a focus on strengthening buy-in and organisational awareness of the benefits of open data within the broader context of the transition of the city and region to a knowledge economy.

The key questions the city had to tackle at this stage of maturity were things like

* what data is available?
* what can we collect?
* what are the privacy considerations?
* what format do we store it in.

SLIDE: Digital Geelong strategy
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/digitalgeelong

These were codified in mid-2015 into the Digital Geelong strategy, which covered a broad range of digital infrastructure topics. The strategy also covered how open data needed to address privacy considerations - ensuring that individuals weren't able to be identified using aggregate data.

Kathy
SLIDE: Choosing data.gov.au as an open data platform

One of the key decisions at this stage was the adoption of the data.gov.au platform, based on CKAN software, versus data.vic.gov.au, based on Socrata. They key drivers for this decision were

* CKAN was open source - and more readily integrated and adapted
* Standardisation - all the Councils collect data - we do it differently and we should do it in the same way - including sharing meta data and formats.



# Level 2 - Hack the data

The next step in open data maturity came with our involvement in GovHack in 2015, which saw the release of several new data sets. GovHack's first year was a great success, seeing over 40 hackers, data mentors and observers come together to deliver some incredible projects, including:

SLIDE: Geelong 2065
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/govhack3

This project, Geelong 2065, by Jaimie McGlashan and Jake Kays, used multiple data sets to predit the growth in community services - schools, libraries, hospitals, recreation and parkland, that would be needed if the region's strong population growth continues out to 2065.

SLIDE: Mighty Ducks - waterway visualisation
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/govhack4

This project - Mighty Ducks - connected GIS data with the Atlas of Living Australia to provide a visualisation of how species along water drainage routes are impacted by rubbish in waterways - it really is one of the most creative data visualisations we've seen.

We also learned some lessons from GovHack.

SLIDE: Hard to compete as a regional city
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/learning1

* As a regional city, it's really hard to compete with the larger event in Melbourne, that regularly draws over 200 hackers. To put on GovHack, it takes about 80 hours of volunteer labour, and about $12-$13k a year to cover things like bounties, catering, and so on. When you're only able to draw between 20-40 hackers for an event, it becomes a lot of effort - and money - for only a handful of projects.


Matt 
SLIDE: Geelong free WiFi
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/geelongfreewifi

* As a weekend hackathon, the outputs from GovHack are prototypes - very robust prototypes - but not able to be deployed immediately. They need a lot of work and iteration to be production ready. In one case, we took a project from GovHack 2015 - Geelong Free WiFi, by Daniel McCarthy and Paz, and then matured it into a production ready product.

SLIDE: Mature products into prototypes
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/learning2

So that was a key learning - you need a pipeline or broader innovation program that provides a mechanism for prototypes to be matured into production.

SLIDE: Geelong advertiser

* Another key issue that we faced with the growing release of open data was the way it could be used both positively - in the case of GovHack - or to paint the city in a more negative light. Organisations who want to release open data need to have a certain risk appetite - as City of Greater Geelong did - you need to be prepared to say "yes, some people will take this and use it negatively, but the trade-off is much broader and greater positive outcomes".

SLIDE: You need a risk appetite

# Level 3 - Track the data

Matt

SLIDE: Level 3 - Track the data
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/level3

After two years of GovHack, one of the lessons we learned was the difficulty that open data consumers had in finding Geelong-related open data. So, we decided to surface that information through a Geelong open data portal, which we can then track with additional metrics, which are used for continuous improvement.

SLIDE: Geelong open data portal
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/opendataportal

Those metrics showed some very interesting trends indeed.

SLIDE: Geelong open data portal metrics
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/opendatastats

You can see here that the most downloaded data set is the Wages and Salaries dataset for the City of Greater Geelong - with urban planning-based datasets like flood extent or building applications a bit further down the list. The learning here is that the community is very interested in openness from Council on its internal operations - and interested in very public measures of accountability such as this.

Kathy

SLIDE: GEEmap
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/geemap

We're also using open data to help connect different services in the city, and a key example of this is the GEEmap platform - which interactively visualises services available to entrepreneurs in the region.

Matt
SLIDE: Clever and Creative
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/clevercreative

As the maturity of Geelong's open data efforts, and digital Geelong strategy, continued, the broader landscape itself was being examined closely as part of the region's efforts to develop a vision and strategy to shape the city for the next 30 years. After consultation with over 16,000 community members, the result was the 'Clever and Creative' vision.

SLIDE: Clever and Creative quote
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/by2047

And of course, open data, and smart cities have a huge role to play here as well.

Kathy
SLIDE: UNESCO Creative City of Design
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/unesco

In fact, Geelong's use of open data, and our orientation towards becoming a smart city, was used to support our recent application to become a UNESCO Creative City of Design - and we're *delighted* to announce that in December 2017 we were successfully awarded this designation.

The mission of the UNESCO Creative Cities network is to ensure creativity and cultural industries are at the heart of urban development - aligning perfectly with Geelong's mission to be the Clever and Creative city.



# Level 4 - The knack of data
Matt

SLIDE: Level 4 - The knack of data
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/level4

Using the learnings gleaned from GovHack, the City then participated in MAVHack in 2017, where the format was conducive to development over a longer timeframe.

@TODO - Matt can you please add in something about MAVhack please? Some wording around it and why it sits at his maturity level.

SLIDE: Smart bollards
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/bollards

Also showing an increase in maturity, the City has recently taken another step beyond simply _capturing_ open data, to using **sensors** in SMART BOLLARDS to _generate_ open data, which is then stored in the Geelong Open Data Portal. In this case, the sensors are designed for smart parking - over time it's anticipated that different sensors will be used for other purposes such as smart lighting.

This is a great example of how the City is using digital infrastructure not just to deliver services more quickly, or more efficiently, but actually deliver **differentiated** services - services that align with the expectations of clever, creative, digitally connected citizens.



# Level 5 - Data backbone

Kathy
SLIDE: Level 5 - data backbone
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/level5

We're not _quite_ at this level, but we do have some thoughts on what this level entails.

Just as our city now has a Green Spine, connecting east and west through a biodiverse corridor, our Smart City will be interconnected, with data providing the backbone, the structure, which is used to inform urban planning and civic decision-making - linking the creation of open data _by_ actors in the city to the city's continual _redevelopment_ in a continual data lifecycle.

SLIDE: Brought to life by data
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/cityasdata

Of course this data will be dependent on networks to carry it - like nerves carrying messages between buildings, between vehicles, between infrastructure and between people.

The City itself will become itself a living being, brought to life by data.

Last point - Matt to talk about future of data smart cities at cogg etc??? 

SLIDE: Thank you
