# From data hacks to smart cities

## Introduction

Welcome to Geelong - we think it's the best city in Australia, but, we _might_ be a little biased ;-)

I'm MATT _Matt to put introduction in here_

And I'm KATHY REID - I'm a technical specialist and was the site lead for GovHack Geelong in 2015 and 2016 - and just to be clear, I'm NOT a City employee - which means I can say things that Matt can't *grin*.



## The Geelong Method - maturity model

SLIDE: Capability Maturity Model
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/capabilitymaturity

Today we're going to take you on the journey of Geelong's evolution and transformation of Geelong's open data and smart city thinking. We're going to do this using a *maturity model* framework - many of you will be familiar with these in different disciplines - and the different levels within the maturity model - *The Geelong Method* - will be signposted by several achievements of the City and the region.

We'd love to hear your questions and comments, however please do wait until the end of the talk - we'll warmly welcome them then.



## Level 1 - Lack of data

SLIDE: Level 1 - Lack of data
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/level1

Our journey starts almost five years ago, with the recognition by the City of the need to recognise the power of Open Data to contribute to the knowledge-based economy the area was transitioning to. At this stage, open data efforts were generally ad-hoc, with a focus on strengthening buy-in and organisational awareness of the benefits of open data within the broader context of the transition of the city and region to a knowledge economy.

The key questions the city had to tackle at this stage of maturity were things like

* what data is available?
* what can we collect?
* what format do we store it in.

SLIDE: Digital Geelong strategy

These were codified in mid-2015 into the Digital Geelong strategy, which covered a broad range of digital infrastructure topics.

SLIDE: Choosing data.gov.au as an open data platform

One of the key decisions at this stage was the adoption of the data.gov.au platform, based on CKAN software, versus data.vic.gov.au, based on Socrata.

@TODO - Matt were there some key drivers from CoGG that led to the decision to adopt data.gov.au. I'm guessing it was the open source nature of CKAN vs Socrata being more expensive



# Level 2 - Hack the data

SLIDE: Level 2 - Hack the data

The next step in open data maturity came with our involvement in GovHack in 2015, which saw the release of several new data sets. GovHack's first year was a great success, seeing over 40 hackers, data mentors and observers come together to deliver some incredible projects, including:

SLIDE: Geelong 2065
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/govhack3

This project, Geelong 2065, by Jaimie McGlashan and Jake Kays, used multiple data sets to predit the growth in community services - schools, libraries, hospitals, recreation and parkland, that would be needed if the region's strong population growth continues out to 2065.

SLIDE: Mighty Ducks - waterway visualisation
https://kathyreid.github.io/transformers-city-geelong-2018/#/govhack4

This project - Mighty Ducks - connected GIS data with the Atlas of Living Australia to provide a visualisation of how species along water drainage routes are impacted by rubbish in waterways - it really is one of the most creative data visualisations we've seen.

We also learned some lessons from GovHack.

* As a regional city, it's really hard to compete with the larger event in Melbourne, that regularly draws over 200 hackers. To put on GovHack, it takes about 80 hours of volunteer labour, and about $12-$13k a year to cover things like bounties, catering, and so on. When you're only able to draw between 20-40 hackers for an event, it becomes a lot of effort - and money - for only a handful of projects.

* As a weekend hackathon, the outputs from GovHack are prototypes - very robust prototypes - but not able to be deployed immediately.
